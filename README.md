🖖 Hello everyone! I'm Mr. Bricenode, a full stack developer passionate about creating innovative digital solutions.

📕A graduate of "epitech" school, I've spent the last five years of my career in web development, preceded by two years as a network administrator in Switzerland.

💻 As a full stack developer, I've had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects in the blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) domain, while also developing websites and applications for driving schools and small businesses.

⚡Here's an overview of my contributions, when i was a validator on several public or private testnet projects :

- I've contributed to enhancing network monitoring scripts to ensure reliability and improved performance during the deployment of test networks for various blockchains.

- I've participated in bug fixes and the implementation of security tests to ensure a secure and reliable testing environment.

- I've added multi-chain deployment functionalities to simplify the configuration of blockchain networks, making it easier for developers to deploy complex test environments.

- I've played a crucial role in providing detailed documentation and user guides to facilitate integration and usage of the projects, helping users fully leverage their features.

- Additionally, I've created Word tutorials for beginners to delve into running node and better understand the intricacies of this domain.

✅️ Example projects include "MASSA" and "DYM".

📈 These projects have allowed me to gain in-depth expertise in all aspects of web development, from design to programming, including security and user experience.

🔍 My commitment to these projects reflects my passion for technology and my desire to contribute to projects that drive industry progress.

👀 I'm interested in working on more Node.js projects. with collaborators
